The loaves stacked high on platters right from the beginning as he summarized the Devconnect trip. DVT remains a loaf in the oven and MEV was hotly debated. The team participated in several panels. Just as the space went live Dave announced that the oDAO bootstrap was to be disabled this month. All mouths watered though as Ken prodded about the 10x node operator proposal Dave had put forward. The team was proposing a change to the EJECTION_BALANCE that will hopefully reduce the ETH requirement. trading was already feeling bread induced inebriation. In parallel, the Rocket Pool team are working on introducing a new Staking as a Service layer based on a node wallet smart contract. In theory, this may allow node operators to provide only RPL and stake ETH. The business applications were appreciated as the Node Operator Association was referenced in helping provide the proper dough recipe. Faced with copious carboloading, Langers pulled back the throttle as discussion shifted to governance. Snapshot is still being set up by Nick while multiple voting strategies are explored. While the pDAO matures, the oDAO will be looking to expand soon. As a parting loaf, Langers revealed that the team will be posting a job listing for two positions. A full time community manager and a part-time community evangelist. POAP development: superphiz, POAP distribution: Kairy Hiwis, POAP design: sleety.eth, descriptive text: jasperthefriendlyghost.eth and friends."

Midnight saw this pool go live and with it, a huge influx of deposits, which triggered a spree of over $20 million TVL in the Curve pool and the creation of 236 minipools. This is a POAP for everyone who commented on the Rocket Pool discord on March 10th, 2022. This day will be remembered as a key catalyst in the growth of the Rocket Pool protocol. Thanks Jasper!

  title: JCRTP Blasts Off!
  description: "This POAP was issued on January 7th 2022 (Epoch timestamp: 1641560400) in commemoration of Joe Clapis becoming a full-time employee of Rocket Pool. Joe started his journey in 2021 as one of us, the degens in #trading. Because in part of his outstanding work on adapting the RP smart stack for use on ARM based processors including the humble Raspberry Pi, Joe became an employee of Rocket Pool on 4/20. https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163979141545995/834277560959500308 On 12/3/21 Joe announced to #trading that he tendered his resignation to his day-time IRL fiat mining job and would work full-time for Rocket Pool. https://discord.com/channels/405159462932971535/405163713063288832/916468166174072832 The advancement of quantum computing was dealt a severe loss of intellect with Joe’s departure for that field of study. This POAP was distributed to all those that congratulated Joe in celebration of his first full day on the job. We hope this means he will be able to use both hemispheres of his brain on all things Ethereum."

Eyes and fingers across the world perked up and DMs filled with resumes and POAP collections were soon sent spinning up connections to further the web3 dream.

  title: "EthStaker Presents: Official Rocket Pool Mainnet Launch"
  description: "Over 4 years ago Rocket Pool was born as an idea for the first ever decentralized staking project for Ethereum. Today we're extremely excited to announce... again, decentralized staking will be a reality on mainnet from 9th November, 2021 00:00 UTC*, just 4 days away! Front end deposits for rETH will open first, then node registrations will be opened about 5m after.<br><br>We've pioneered a solution to the very esoteric exploit that was raised just a day before our initial planned launch date. This exploit not only affected us, but several other live staking platforms as well. The solution has been verified by Sigma Prime and we have upgraded our initial mainnet deployment of Rocket Pool smart contracts and also our smart node stack to bring it inline with these changes. The full report for that can be found here https://rocketpool.net/files/SigmaPri...<br><br>To say this launch is huge milestone for the team... again, and our beloved community would be an epic understatement. Rocket Pool isn't just a standard Ethereum project anymore, it really has become a collective of devs and community combined that have helped craft a once good idea, into a great one."

Dmitri initially decided to report the vulnerability anonymously and by 11PM UTC, Dmitri had written Rocket Pool a detailed report and made contact with their core team under the /latebird/ alias. Rocket Pool soon confirmed the validity of the exploit and by 7AM UTC charted the appropriate course of action to ensure the safety of users’ funds.<br><br>With this act the StakeWise team showed its commitment to fair competition and security of the whole Ethereum ecosystem.<br>This POAP is a fun way to show gratitude from the Rocket Pool to the StakeWise community."

We'll start with a short description of the attack surfaces, and progress to a walkthrough of setting up a VPS server as a staking machine with the most essential security precautions. The tutorial will use a macbook client with a Ubuntu server hosted at a VPS provider. 'Mentor' will be presenting during this livestream as he wrote most of the security documentation for Rocket Pool.

He began his journey in crypto in 2013 with BTC, grew most of his funds with option trading stocks in '19-'20, then fell in love with Ethereum as DeFi took off. He's in it for the long haul, and of course does his taxes. Moving forward he's thinking about starting a DAO to fund research relating to eVTOLs/flying cars (battery tech mostly)."

We were promised all will be revealed this week...but some feel the day may never come. Launch is imminent my friends!"

  title: Rocketpool Discord and the GOAT jcrtp save the future of Ethereum!
  description: On the night of 05/27/2021, @jcrtp came to the Rocketpool Discord to proclaim a 'pool staking' loophole in the Ethereum protocol. He gathered valiant community members @freeb0rn and @poupas to prepare a journey to Eth R&D Discord to offer their decree to the high clergy of Ethereum. As the decree read, the prefix 0x01 was problematic for 'pool staking' protocols like Rocketpool because it allowed node operators the opportunity to funnel part of the minipool's validation rewards to their own wallet without proportionally distributing them to all stakers in the pool. In the words of the survivors, 'a category 5 brainstorm' occured and ETH pope Vitalik Buterin even showed up to calm the tempest. The RP representatives presented the idea of prefix 0x02, a prefix that their grandchildren would remember them by. The future of decentralized staking could be restored!

  title: POEP
  description: This is a story of hope and equality under the POAP law. As a European, too many times have we awoken to review the day’s happenings, only to realise we have yet again missed out on a POAP due to the US monopolising the entire POAP minting and distribution network. Sure, missing one POAP isn’t so bad, but that one POAP quickly become two, three… four. It’s as if they conspire, night after night, to release the most coveted badges while us Europeans are sleeping soundly. Well, no longer! Ironically employing the artistic skills of an American (credit @RPLgrime) we have minted the world’s first European POAP using revolutionary Proof of European Protocol (POEP) technology. On 9th May 2021 in the Rocket Pool discord server, many were celebrating Europe Day and proving they're awake and pro-European by adding an EU flag ‘Reaction’ to the POAP image between the hours of 07:00 GMT and 11:00 GMT. This is their reward.

  title: May the Fourth be With You 2021
  description: "On this 4th of May, we mark a transition. For 5 years, Rocketpool has stood as the crowning vision of decentralized staking. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure a trustless ethereum network, the betas will be reorganized into a testnet, for a safe and secure ecosystem that will last ten-thousand years. Ethereans must do their part. Join our validators, become the node network, and spread the message of decentralization to the TradFi barbarians. We have been tested by the falling ratio, but we have emerged with strong, diamond hands. We move forward as one people: the degens of #trading. We will prevail. Ten thousand years of Rocketpool begins today."

The POAP design was by @Logic_Beach, the name was suggested by dybsy@discord, and superphiz organized the POAP."
