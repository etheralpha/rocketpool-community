        <h3>Node Operators</h3>
        <p>Node operators are Ethereum validators operating Rocket Pool staking pools (minipools). Operating a node requires only 16 ETH per minipool and a minimum of 1.6 ETH worth of RPL (10% collateral). In return, node operators earn ETH staking rewards on their 16 ETH, 5%-20% commission on the staking rewards from the 16 ETH staking pool, and RPL staking rewards.</p>

        <h3>Stakers</h3>
        <p>Stakers can join the Rocket Pool staking pool with as little as 0.01 ETH. As a staker you maintain full custody of your ETH and have full protection against slashing and penalities. In return, stakers recieve the liquid staking token rETH that accrues staking reward interest and allows you to continue to participate in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
